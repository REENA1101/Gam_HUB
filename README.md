Game Rules and Description: 
Its a BlackJack Game App which lets upu draw new cards one after the other, 
if you get a "21" then you will win and the app will show you as won, but if you exceed the blackjack
amount i.e number 21, you will lose. 

Yup you read that right it's that simple, and if you have card number sum below 21 then you always get a chanvce to draw a new card further,
so there you go the mathematical logic is based on this explanation only.

Below the "Draw button" you get the total money you have, and so there you go get ready to draw some
card and win some blackjacks!
